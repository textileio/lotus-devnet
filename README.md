# Lotus Devnet
Runs a Lotus Devnet using a mocked _sectorbuilder_ which can be accesed as a real Lotus node through the API.
This code is experimental.

The devnet code is always up to date with the latest `master` Lotus branch.

## Run
You can run the devnet with:
```bash
go run main.go
```

The devnet supports the following configuration:
- _Speed_ (`-speed`): Time in milliseconds that blocks are mined
- _# Miners_ (`-numminers`): Amount of miners in testnet, default is 1. This feature is experimental, so don't expect to work pefectly for values greater than 1.

It also supports configuration via env-vars with `TEXLOTUSDEVNET_` prefix with capitalized flag names.

## Docker
You can run the image locally or leverage DockerHub images.

### Build locally
The docker-image can be built locally with `docker build .`. 

## Public images
Public images are pushed to DockerHub by the CI. Refer to [textile/lotus-devnet](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/textile/lotus-devnet/tags?page=1).
Run example with block generation in 1.5s intervals:
```bash
docker run -e TEXLOTUSDEVNET_SPEED=1500 textile/lotus-devnet
```
